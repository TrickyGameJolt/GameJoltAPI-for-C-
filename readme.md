# Leaving note!

I am closing my books as far as Game Jolt is concerned!
If you want to fork this repository in order to keep it maintained, be my guest, but I am not going to look into this anymore!

# Simplistic Game Jolt API for C#

This is a very extremely simplistic Game Jolt API written in C#.
Although I've tested this in C# only, I think it should work in other languages set up for the .NET framework, as well.

It's not that I have big plans for this stuff. I only made it for my own purposes, but if you have a use for it, go ahead, take it ;)

The main solution file will create a .dll file for you to import into your project if you desire. 
All required dependencies are by default available in C#, so no additional stuff is needed.
